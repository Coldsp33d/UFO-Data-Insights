## Getting Started

## Part 1 - Visualizations with D3

Scripts for Generating Data for D3 Visualizations can be found in folder: `d3-data-generation-scripts`

Each script name is the name of the visualization followed by the features it uses for analysis. 
To run each file: 

	python dashboard_elevation_statewise_sightings.py

The corresponding data file is generated in `ufo.usc.edu\Data` folder

The D3 HTML files that use this data are found in `ufo.usc.edu\d3-visualizations` with the same naming convention.
